# MLOps-Lab2: Containerization and Continuous Delivery (CD)

This repository continues the MLOps workflow from Lab 1 by introducing **containerization** and extending the pipeline to include **Continuous Delivery**.

### 🎯 Objective
* **Containerize** the machine learning application using a `Dockerfile`.
* Integrate Docker image building into the automated workflow.
* Implement **Continuous Delivery (CD)** via GitHub Actions, which builds and publishes the container image (e.g., to a registry) after successful CI checks.

### 📦 Prerequisites
* Successful completion of Lab 1's CI setup.
* Working knowledge of Docker.
